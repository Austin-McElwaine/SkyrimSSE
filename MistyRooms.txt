A glistening aurora fills the sky with brilliant color.
A glistening aurora fills the sky with brilliant color. Those shader packs were worth the download for sure.
A great mountain stands before you.
Conditions on your footpath look bleak. This is a mountain only a greybeard could love.
Red and blue flowers adorn the rocky base. You would pick one, but you already have ninety-nine.
Storm clouds swirl overhead menacingly.
The peaks of Skyrim seem to touch the sky.
The stars are clearly visible above. You can almost remember all thirteen constellations.
This mountain looks dangerous. One misstep could spell disaster.
Wind whips around the mountain. Looks like a long way to the top.
You begin to ascend the steep mountain with your compass perfectly aligned with your objective. This doesn't work. You begin up the path.
You can either take the path in front of you or try to take many small hops up the sheer rock face. Let's take the path this time.
You gaze up at the darkened sky. Is that the mage or apprentice you see?
Your pack weighs heavy as you start to climb. You almost wish Lydia was here to carry your burdens. Almost.
Your stomach growls loudly as you begin your climb. If only someone hadn't stolen your last sweet roll.
