At the entrance to the forest, you see a cooking spit. Looks like someone had some apple and cabbage stew.
Have you been in these woods before? You can't remember.
Rabbits scatter as you enter the forest. You wonder why they are even in the game.
The forest looks tranquil and calm. What could go wrong?
The sun peeks through the forest canopy and the resulting god rays tank your frame rate.
The trees look ominous. At least it's not as scary as Witchmist Grove.
The woods are humid and cold. This would be a perfect place to gather Fly Amanita, if you had any idea what it was for.
When you approach the forest, you see a bear fighting with two wolves. They don't seem to notice you.
Wind rustles the trees. You start to suspect that Khajiit traveler gave you the wrong directions.
You are surrounded by a misty grove near a lake. It may just be your imagination, but some of the trees seem to be glaring at you.
