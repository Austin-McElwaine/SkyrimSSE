A sprawling cave lies before you. You grab a few mushrooms and head in.
An ominous cave looms in front of you. You try to ignore the odd groaning sounds coming from inside.
It's not clear where this cave will take you. You really don't have time for it to be Blackreach.
Some imp stools are growing around the cave. You'll probably never use them but that doesn't stop you from picking them up.
The cave in front of you seems quiet. Perhaps too quiet.
The cave is dark. Gloomy. You take out one of the lit torches you keep in your pack and proceed.
The cave lies before you. You get a feeling someone - or something - is watching you.
The entrance to the cave is littered with bottles of skooma. Looks like some Khajiit were selling wares here.
You approach the entrance. A cool breeze rises from its depths.
